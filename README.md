# go-bot
Let's make a partner to play Go. There will be a myriad of tasks to eventually reach this end goal, and at a high-level it looks like the following:
- [x] Create a program that properly implements the rules of Go and lets you play the game.
- [ ] Create a bot-player that can play against you (though probably very poorly).
- [ ] Create a basic GUI interface, beyond that of a terminal application.
- [ ] Stretch goals such as:
    * A bot with some means of "intelligence".
    * A networked component to the game, for online play.
    * Cross-compilation, portability, and general GUI polishing.

At the moment here is a personal To-Do list of things I need to clean up (may be out of date):
1. Expand upon the current TUI by adding basic menu and escape commands.
2. Clarify and add a proper break/win condition.
3. Substantially expand the test section
4. Add some basic documentation
